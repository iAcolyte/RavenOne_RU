18:20, Ready Room \
\
The telephone on the desk of duty officer rang, piercing the otherwise quiet room, not counting the monotonous humming of ship’s machinery. Sponge Bob, who was the duty officer, picked it up almost immediately. Flip and Olive - only other people present in the room - lifted their heads and looked at one another before turning their gaze to lieutenant junior grade, who listened for a while before saying: “Roger that, I’ll pass it on”. After hanging up, he looked at his OPSO and said:\
\
“Sir, you’re going up, They will announce Alert 30 in a moment”. Flip, they’re calling away the alert 30 SUCAP!\"\
\
“Thanks. Do you know what this is about?”.\
\
“Negative, but it sure doesn’t look like a drill to me”.\
\
Before Flip could respond, ship’s 1MC came to life:\
\
“This is the TAO. Now launch the alert 30 SUCAP. Now launch the alert 30 SUCAP!”\
\
They immediately got up and ran out of the room.\

18:28, Flight Deck\
\
Flip stopped next to the ladder to 403 when he saw Cajun trotting along the flight deck towards him. He saluted.\
\
“Skipper! Do we know what is going on?” - they had to shout in order to be heard due to the wind sweeping over the deck and noise made by Switchblade, SAR helicopter getting on station overhead. \
\
“Yes. Iranians made a move against USS Richard Best in the Strait of Hormuz and attacked her with fast movers. From what we know they took some damage and are DIW, they may need help if the attackers return!”\
\
“Whoa!” \
\
“Exactly. Be smart and good hunting!”\
\
“Will do, Skipper!”\
\
---------- DESIGNER'S NOTES ----------\
\
Olive will start up as soon as you perform Radio Checks.\
Wait for Olive on the CAT and then let her rejoin, don't make her chase you. Alternatively, after takeoff make a circle and wait for her to take off. \
\
Do not start taxiing before you get the SPACE BAR option to perform radio checks.\

17:33, Ready Room 7\
\
Flip and Olive went through all the routine steps in preparation for standing the Alert-30: they wrote down Air Ops Info, checked the air plan, got the cards of the day, signed for their jets in Maintenance Control, then preflighted them. After that they went to the Ready Room. Wilson took out a map of part of the Gulf they were currently in - Valley Forge was passing around 25 miles from Dubai - and began the briefing. \
\
“Okay, alert 30, the ship is MODLOC'ed at our present lat/long, weather OK with some scattered clouds. I'm in 403, you're in 410, both jets are parked on elevator 4, each loaded with two Mavericks. If they call away the alert let's run to get dressed and to the jet. Start and taxi standard, let's get a comm check on both radios. Combat checklist on deck. Remember, off the cat turn in the nearest direction to the threat and we'll join en route if we can. If they shoot us off two cats and it looks close for whoever is off second, then the first off float your turn so the second can join and we can affect the intercept with section integrity. If they shoot the alert Knight with us we'll probably work under their control but we'll let Strike assign us. Olive, I’ll wait for you to rejoin keeping below 350 knots. When we’re together, fence checks on my mark. \
\
The tactical situation is as follows: we have one of our escorts 20 miles further up north - east along the coast and three US frigates next to us in plane guard plus USS Richard Best transiting Hormuz as we speak”. \
\
Flip gestured over the map, marking position of allied vessels with his fingers. \
\
“Now on to possible airborne threats. After Prince was shot down Iranians are keeping a rather low profile and we shouldn’t expect anything different tonight. Still, stay alert and be extra careful - we cannot rule out another surprise attack. We will sort any problems directly with Strike.\
\
If we’re up against surface threats, unless they are attacking civilian vessel or any other ship, we will try to birddog them and force them to retreat. If they are using deadly force, we will check with Strike and wait for guidance, we’re still operating under peacetime ROE. Going to adapt to what we find. \
\
We’re operating close to UAE and we should try not to enter their airspace so let’s stay out of their airspace, although since they are having their own trouble with the Iranians, I don’t think they would get too upset. We should also watch out not to get too close to Iranian islands to the north and north - west. \
\
If we have to take off during dawn, we’ll check the NVGs and verify if they are usable or not. \
\
Down plane/ SAR. We’re close to UAE territorial waters and our own assets, so there should be plenty of assets available. I've got you, you've got me, break out the SAR checklist. The water is not that cold, anyway”. \
\
Flip paused to take a deep breath, looking through his notes.\
\
“OK. Keep track of the ship and let's get back here with no less than 3.0 min first pass fuel. Listen up if they launch a tanker. If it’s light enough for Case 1, Standard check in with Marshal, see the ship at ten and switch tower, I'll bring us overhead and if the deck's clear with the lens on I'll bring us through the initial, get yourself in parade, break at the bow, you break 17 seconds later, good abeam at 600 feet, 450 at the ninety, 375 as you pick up the ball, aggressive corrections early, look for cut lights, trap. If still night Case 3, then I’ll kiss you off so you can check in with marshal and get your approach instructions on your own.\
